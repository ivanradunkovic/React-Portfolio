            <p>I am 32 years old, married to wife Matea, we live in Osijek.
            I have a Bachelor degree in Computer Science from University Josip Juraj Strossmayer Osijek.
            I was working as IT Administrator for almost 5 years in HF Belišće.
            In 2019 I got my Java developer certificate in Edunova Osijek.
            Since then I am learning React and other programming languages. React in my favorite :)
            On my Github profile you can see my work.
            I love playing World of Warcraft when I have time, and riding bike.
            I love food and Coca-Cola.
